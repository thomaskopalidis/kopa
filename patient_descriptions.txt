https://www.mdcalc.com/calc/3987/new-york-heart-association-nyha-functional-classification-heart-failure).
Also, the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of the patient Magiorkinis Charalampos  is 26.0%.
According to the American College of Cardiology (ACC), the patient has Severe dysfunction (LVEF < 30%) 
For information, Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is the central measure of left ventricular systolic function. LVEF is the fraction of chamber volume ejected in systole (stroke volume) in relation to the volume of the blood in the ventricle at the end of diastole (end-diastolic volume).
(Source: https://www.healthline.com/health/ejection-fraction#ejection-fraction-results, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459131/).
Regarding diabetes, the patient Magiorkinis Charalampos has been diagnosed with diabetes.
Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot
effectively use the insulin it produces. Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood glucose. Hyperglycaemia, also called raised blood glucose,
is a common effect of uncontrolled diabetes and over time leads to serious damage to many of the body's systems, especially the nerves and blood vessels.
 The patient Magiorkinis Charalampos is a smoker.
 The patient Magiorkinis Charalampos has COPD disease. For Information, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the name for a group of lung conditions that cause breathing difficulties. It includes: emphysema – damage to the air sacs in the lungs or chronic bronchitis – long-term inflammation of the airways. COPD is a common condition that mainly affects middle-aged or older adults who smoke. Many people do not realise they have it.The breathing problems tend to get gradually worse over time and can limit your normal activities, although treatment can help keep the condition under control.
The patient's Magiorkinis Charalampos systolic pressure is 150 mm Hg and is characterized as 'High Blood Pressure Stage 2' (140 or higher systolic pressure).
Regarding heart failure medications, the patient doesn't take beta blockers therapy. Moreover, doesn't take ACE inhibitors or ARBs therapy.
The patient Magiorkinis Charalampos has a creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL and is categorized as High (above 1.2 mg/dL).
(Source: https://www.healthline.com/health/low-creatinine#creatinine-levels.)
The Body Mass Index (BMI) of the patient Magiorkinis Charalampos is 25.0.
Body mass index (BMI) is a measure of body fat based on height and weight that applies to adult men and women.
So, based on the existing scientific literature, the patient Magiorkinis Charalampos with this BMI can be characterized as 'Overweight'.
(Source: https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/BMI/bmicalc.htm.).
Finally, patient Magiorkinis Charalampos has heart failure diagnosed within the past 18 months.
Based on all the above characteristics, patient's Magiorkinis Charalampos MAGGIC score is 34 and this MAGGIC score is categorized as High Risk.
The predicted mortality of the patient Magiorkinis Charalampos for 1-Year is 34.2%. Namely, there is a 34.2% change that the patient may not survive within the next year due to heart-related conditions.
The predicted mortality of the patient Magiorkinis Charalampos for 3-Year is 65.8%. Namely, there is a 65.8% change that the patient may not survive within the next three years due to heart-related conditions.

MESSAGE FOR PATIENT:
The condition is serious, with increased risk to your health. However, measures can be taken to improve the situation.
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PATIENT Magiorkinis Charalampos:
- Since your low ejection fraction is low (LVEF < 40), you can follow instructions that will help to  improve your injection fraction.The average American consumes nearly 3,400 mg of sodium per day, which is more than double the recommended amount. Aim to reduce salt consumption to align with recommended levels. Check food labels and avoid processed or high-sodium foods. Discuss with your cardiologist the appropriate amount of fluids you should consume daily. Also, engage in physical activity for at least 30 minutes per day, three days a week. (Source: https://www.pennmedicine.org/updates/blogs/heart-and-vascular-blog/2022/april/ejection-fraction-what-the-numbers-mean.)
- Quitting smoking is one of the most impactful steps you can take to improve your health. Smoking increases the risk of serious illnesses like heart disease and lung cancer. Start by setting a quit date within the next two weeks to stay focused and committed. Seek support through counseling and consider using nicotine replacement therapies like patches or gums to ease withdrawal symptoms. Your healthcare provider can also recommend medications to help you quit. Creating a smoke-free environment and identifying triggers can make a big difference in your journey (Source: https://cdphe.colorado.gov/prevention-and-wellness/smoking-and-tobacco/quit-tobacco/recommendations-for-reducing-tobacco-use).
- Managing diabetes involves a healthy lifestyle and a personalized care plan. A balanced diet is essential, focusing on nutrient-rich foods such as non-starchy vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats. Limit refined sugars and simple carbohydrates, manage your carbohydrate intake, and choose foods with a low glycemic index. Regular physical activity is vital,  for at least 30 minutes or more of moderate physical activity most days of the week, or at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity a week. Bouts of activity can be a few minutes during the day. If you haven't been active for a while, start slowly and build up slowly. Also avoid sitting for too long. Try to get up and move if you've been sitting for more than 30 minutes. (Source: https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20371451.)   Monitor blood sugar levels regularly, understand how food, exercise, and medication affect them, and react appropriately to high or low levels. Consult your doctor about whether you should take diabetes medication (e.g., insulin, oral medication). Manage stress with techniques such as meditation or yoga, as stress can affect blood sugar. Regular check-ups and preventative care are vital to identify and manage complications such as eye, kidney, nerve, or heart problems (Source: https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/healthy-living-with-diabetes).
- Since your systolic blood pressure is high, focus on eating colorful fruits and vegetables, since their high potassium content can help lower blood pressure. Choose whole grains whenever possible, and limit white flours such as those found in white bread and pasta. Avoid drinking sweetened drinks like juice and soda, and watch for salt in processed foods and canned items. Limit intake of saturated fat by choosing lean meats like skinless chicken and turkey. Choose low-fat or nonfat dairy items (Source: https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-to-lower-systolic-blood-pressure-5202628).
- Consult your doctor if beta blocker therapy is necessary.
- Consult your doctor if ACE inhibitors or ARBs therapy is necessary.
- The patient has high creatinine levels. High creatinine levels may indicate that your kidneys aren’t filtering your blood properly.  Consult your doctor to tell you what you should do to decrease your creatinine levels to normal levels. (Source: https://www.healthline.com/health/low-creatinine#treatment.).
- As you are a smoker and have COPD, it is critical to quit smoking immediately. Smoking exacerbates COPD symptoms, causes further damage to your lungs, and worsens your overall condition.
- Since you are diagnosed as overweight person, it’s important to follow their recommendations of your doctor for losing weight. Health professionals recommend losing 5% to 10% of your initial weight over the course of about 6 months. But a loss of just 3% to 5% of your current weight can lower triglycerides and glucose levels in your blood, as well as your risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Losing more than 3% to 5% of your weight can improve blood pressure readings, lower “bad” LDL cholesterol, and increase “good” HDL cholesterol. (Source: https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/heart-truth/maintain-a-healthy-weight).

MESSAGE FOR DOCTOR:
The patient is at high risk and requires intensive management. Comprehensive and multidisciplinary care is critical.
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR DOCTOR TO PATIENT Magiorkinis Charalampos:
- The patient has a low ejection fraction (LVEF < 40). Υou may suggest treatments such as an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) or a pacemaker to help regulate the heart rhythm and prevent sudden cardiac arrest (Source: https://www.healthline.com/health/ejection-fraction#low-ef-causes.)
- Recommend quit-smoking medications to patients, including nicotine replacement therapies (such as nicotine patches, lozenges, gum, oral inhalers, and nasal sprays) and prescription medications like varenicline and bupropion SR (Source: https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/campaign/tips/quit-smoking/quit-smoking-medications/how-to-use-quit-smoking-medicines/index.html).
- The patient has diabetes. Υou can provide the following guidelines to help the patient manage their diabetes effectively:
 Perform a comprehensive medical evaluation to classify diabetes, and evaluate for complications or comorbidities.
 Review prior treatment history and risk factor control to identify gaps in management.
 Develop an individualized care plan that includes therapeutic goals, lifestyle changes, and ongoing monitoring.
 At follow-up visits, reassess overall health, diabetes complications, cardiovascular risk, and hypoglycemia risk.
 Use shared decision-making to set and adjust therapeutic goals, ensuring the patient is engaged in their care.
 Promote healthy lifestyle habits such as a nutrient-dense diet, regular physical activity, weight management, and stress reduction techniques.
 Regularly monitor blood glucose levels and HbA1c to assess treatment efficacy and identify complications early.
 Recommend preventive care, including regular eye exams, foot care, and kidney function monitoring
(Source: https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20371451).
- The patient has COPD. There are various treatment options to discuss with the patient, such as quitting smoking, using inhalers (the first treatment used are short-acting bronchodilator inhalers (beta-2 agonist inhalers such as salbutamol and terbutaline and antimuscarinic inhalers such as ipratropium. The next phase if  the patient experience symptoms regularly or have flare-ups (exacerbations) despite using short-acting bronchodilators, a long-acting bronchodilator inhaler may be recommended i.e. beta-2 agonist inhalers – such as salmeterol, formoterol and indacaterol and antimuscarinic inhalers – such as tiotropium, glycopyronium and aclidinium.), steroid inhalers if the long-acting bronchodilator inhaler didn't make any difference to the symptoms consider tablets (Source: https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-copd/treatment/)
- Since the systolic blood pressure is high, consider prescribing one of the following medications, which are effective at reducing blood pressure: 1. diuretics such as Hygroton (chlorthalidone), Microzide (hydrochlorothiazide). 2. Calcium channel Blocker such as Norvasc (amlodipine) and Adalat CC (nifedipine). Also, advise the patient to avoid the following substances, which can negatively impact blood pressure management i.e.  Over-the-counter 'decongestant' cold medications that contain pseudoephedrine or phenylephrine, like Sudafed, chronic use of NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications), like Motrin (ibuprofen), Advil (ibuprofen), and Aleve (naproxen). Also, black licorice and cocaine (Source: https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-to-lower-systolic-blood-pressure-5202628).
- Consider administering Beta blocker therapy (Bisoprolol (Zebeta), Carvedilol (Coreg), Metoprolol (Toprol))  to the patient, if necessary. Also, the goal is to convince the patient not to neglect taking Beta blocker therapy since they are very important (Source: https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/heart-failure/heart-failure-beta-blocker) .
- Consider administering ACE inhibitors (e.g. enalapril) or ARBs therapy (e.g. losartan) to the patient, if necessary. Also, the goal is to convince the patient not to neglect taking ACE inhibitors or ARB since they are very important.
- The patient has high creatinine levels. As a doctor, you can recommend to the patient to follow a healthy lifestyle, make changes to the patient's diet to avoid stress on patient's kidneys, cut back on strenuous exercise, avoid creatine supplements  and discuss to the patient the medications that can have i.e. over-the-counter medicine. (Source: https://www.freseniuskidneycare.com/thrive-central/what-are-high-creatinine-levels).
- The patient has been diagnosed as overweight, suggest the patient to follow some instructions to lose weight  such as reducing consumption of fast foods, reducing portion sizes and reducing soda consumption (Source: https://www.jabfm.org/content/22/2/115#abstract-1).

MESSAGE FOR PATIENT:
There is a moderate risk to your health. With certain adjustments, your prognosis can improve. By taking proactive steps and following your doctor’s instructions, you can reduce your risk and improve your quality of life.
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PATIENT Petridou Iwanna:
- Since your low ejection fraction is low (LVEF < 40), you can follow instructions that will help to  improve your injection fraction.The average American consumes nearly 3,400 mg of sodium per day, which is more than double the recommended amount. Aim to reduce salt consumption to align with recommended levels. Check food labels and avoid processed or high-sodium foods. Discuss with your cardiologist the appropriate amount of fluids you should consume daily. Also, engage in physical activity for at least 30 minutes per day, three days a week. (Source: https://www.pennmedicine.org/updates/blogs/heart-and-vascular-blog/2022/april/ejection-fraction-what-the-numbers-mean.)
- Avoid smoking as this can increase your risk of cardiovascular diseases.
- Since your systolic blood pressure is high, focus on eating colorful fruits and vegetables, since their high potassium content can help lower blood pressure. Choose whole grains whenever possible, and limit white flours such as those found in white bread and pasta. Avoid drinking sweetened drinks like juice and soda, and watch for salt in processed foods and canned items. Limit intake of saturated fat by choosing lean meats like skinless chicken and turkey. Choose low-fat or nonfat dairy items (Source: https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-to-lower-systolic-blood-pressure-5202628).
- Consult your doctor if beta blocker therapy is necessary.
- The patient has high creatinine levels. High creatinine levels may indicate that your kidneys aren’t filtering your blood properly.  Consult your doctor to tell you what you should do to decrease your creatinine levels to normal levels. (Source: https://www.healthline.com/health/low-creatinine#treatment.).
- You have COPD, so you need to avoiding triggers such as dust, fumes, and extreme temperatures can minimize flare-ups. Also, vaccinations against flu, pneumonia, and COVID-19 are essential to prevent infections that could worsen the condition.  Breathing techniques, like pursed-lip breathing, and physical activity help improve lung function and stamina  (Source: https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-copd/living-with/).
- Since you are diagnosed as overweight person, it’s important to follow their recommendations of your doctor for losing weight. Health professionals recommend losing 5% to 10% of your initial weight over the course of about 6 months. But a loss of just 3% to 5% of your current weight can lower triglycerides and glucose levels in your blood, as well as your risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Losing more than 3% to 5% of your weight can improve blood pressure readings, lower “bad” LDL cholesterol, and increase “good” HDL cholesterol. (Source: https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/heart-truth/maintain-a-healthy-weight).

(Source: https://www.pennmedicine.org/updates/blogs/heart-and-vascular-blog/2022/april/ejection-fraction-what-the-numbers-mean.)
- Quitting smoking is one of the most impactful steps you can take to improve your health. Smoking increases the risk of serious illnesses like heart disease and lung cancer. Start by setting a quit date within the next two weeks to stay focused and committed. Seek support through counseling and consider using nicotine replacement therapies like patches or gums to ease withdrawal symptoms. Your healthcare provider can also recommend medications to help you quit. Creating a smoke-free environment and identifying triggers can make a big difference in your journey (Source: https://cdphe.colorado.gov/prevention-and-wellness/smoking-and-tobacco/quit-tobacco/recommendations-for-reducing-tobacco-use).
- Managing diabetes involves a healthy lifestyle and a personalized care plan. A balanced diet is essential, focusing on nutrient-rich foods such as non-starchy vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats. Limit refined sugars and simple carbohydrates, manage your carbohydrate intake, and choose foods with a low glycemic index. Regular physical activity is vital,  for at least 30 minutes or more of moderate physical activity most days of the week, or at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity a week. Bouts of activity can be a few minutes during the day. If you haven't been active for a while, start slowly and build up slowly. Also avoid sitting for too long. Try to get up and move if you've been sitting for more than 30 minutes. (Source: https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20371451.)   Monitor blood sugar levels regularly, understand how food, exercise, and medication affect them, and react appropriately to high or low levels. Consult your doctor about whether you should take diabetes medication (e.g., insulin, oral medication). Manage stress with techniques such as meditation or yoga, as stress can affect blood sugar. Regular check-ups and preventative care are vital to identify and manage complications such as eye, kidney, nerve, or heart problems (Source: https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/healthy-living-with-diabetes).
- Since your systolic blood pressure is high, focus on eating colorful fruits and vegetables, since their high potassium content can help lower blood pressure. Choose whole grains whenever possible, and limit white flours such as those found in white bread and pasta. Avoid drinking sweetened drinks like juice and soda, and watch for salt in processed foods and canned items. Limit intake of saturated fat by choosing lean meats like skinless chicken and turkey. Choose low-fat or nonfat dairy items (Source: https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-to-lower-systolic-blood-pressure-5202628).
- Consult your doctor if beta blocker therapy is necessary.
- Consult your doctor if ACE inhibitors or ARBs therapy is necessary.
- The patient has high creatinine levels. High creatinine levels may indicate that your kidneys aren’t filtering your blood properly.  Consult your doctor to tell you what you should do to decrease your creatinine levels to normal levels. (Source: https://www.healthline.com/health/low-creatinine#treatment.).
- As you are a smoker and have COPD, it is critical to quit smoking immediately. Smoking exacerbates COPD symptoms, causes further damage to your lungs, and worsens your overall condition.
- Your BMI is in the normal range, which is great for your overall health. Focus on maintaining your current weight and healthy habits.

MESSAGE FOR PATIENT:
The condition is serious, with increased risk to your health. However, measures can be taken to improve the situation.
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PATIENT Kalantzis Pantelhs:
- Since your low ejection fraction is low (LVEF < 40), you can follow instructions that will help to  improve your injection fraction.The average American consumes nearly 3,400 mg of sodium per day, which is more than double the recommended amount. Aim to reduce salt consumption to align with recommended levels. Check food labels and avoid processed or high-sodium foods. Discuss with your cardiologist the appropriate amount of fluids you should consume daily. Also, engage in physical activity for at least 30 minutes per day, three days a week. (Source: https://www.pennmedicine.org/updates/blogs/heart-and-vascular-blog/2022/april/ejection-fraction-what-the-numbers-mean.)
- Quitting smoking is one of the most impactful steps you can take to improve your health. Smoking increases the risk of serious illnesses like heart disease and lung cancer. Start by setting a quit date within the next two weeks to stay focused and committed. Seek support through counseling and consider using nicotine replacement therapies like patches or gums to ease withdrawal symptoms. Your healthcare provider can also recommend medications to help you quit. Creating a smoke-free environment and identifying triggers can make a big difference in your journey (Source: https://cdphe.colorado.gov/prevention-and-wellness/smoking-and-tobacco/quit-tobacco/recommendations-for-reducing-tobacco-use).
- Managing diabetes involves a healthy lifestyle and a personalized care plan. A balanced diet is essential, focusing on nutrient-rich foods such as non-starchy vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats. Limit refined sugars and simple carbohydrates, manage your carbohydrate intake, and choose foods with a low glycemic index. Regular physical activity is vital,  for at least 30 minutes or more of moderate physical activity most days of the week, or at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity a week. Bouts of activity can be a few minutes during the day. If you haven't been active for a while, start slowly and build up slowly. Also avoid sitting for too long. Try to get up and move if you've been sitting for more than 30 minutes. (Source: https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20371451.)   Monitor blood sugar levels regularly, understand how food, exercise, and medication affect them, and react appropriately to high or low levels. Consult your doctor about whether you should take diabetes medication (e.g., insulin, oral medication). Manage stress with techniques such as meditation or yoga, as stress can affect blood sugar. Regular check-ups and preventative care are vital to identify and manage complications such as eye, kidney, nerve, or heart problems (Source: https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/healthy-living-with-diabetes).
- Since your systolic blood pressure is high, focus on eating colorful fruits and vegetables, since their high potassium content can help lower blood pressure. Choose whole grains whenever possible, and limit white flours such as those found in white bread and pasta. Avoid drinking sweetened drinks like juice and soda, and watch for salt in processed foods and canned items. Limit intake of saturated fat by choosing lean meats like skinless chicken and turkey. Choose low-fat or nonfat dairy items (Source: https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-to-lower-systolic-blood-pressure-5202628).
- Consult your doctor if beta blocker therapy is necessary.
- The patient has high creatinine levels. High creatinine levels may indicate that your kidneys aren’t filtering your blood properly.  Consult your doctor to tell you what you should do to decrease your creatinine levels to normal levels. (Source: https://www.healthline.com/health/low-creatinine#treatment.).
- As you are a smoker and have COPD, it is critical to quit smoking immediately. Smoking exacerbates COPD symptoms, causes further damage to your lungs, and worsens your overall condition.
- Since you are diagnosed as overweight person, it’s important to follow their recommendations of your doctor for losing weight. Health professionals recommend losing 5% to 10% of your initial weight over the course of about 6 months. But a loss of just 3% to 5% of your current weight can lower triglycerides and glucose levels in your blood, as well as your risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Losing more than 3% to 5% of your weight can improve blood pressure readings, lower “bad” LDL cholesterol, and increase “good” HDL cholesterol. (Source: https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/heart-truth/maintain-a-healthy-weight).

MESSAGE FOR PATIENT:
There is a moderate risk to your health. With certain adjustments, your prognosis can improve. By taking proactive steps and following your doctor’s instructions, you can reduce your risk and improve your quality of life.
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PATIENT Panagiotidis Panagioths:
- Since your low ejection fraction is low (LVEF < 40), you can follow instructions that will help to  improve your injection fraction.The average American consumes nearly 3,400 mg of sodium per day, which is more than double the recommended amount. Aim to reduce salt consumption to align with recommended levels. Check food labels and avoid processed or high-sodium foods. Discuss with your cardiologist the appropriate amount of fluids you should consume daily. Also, engage in physical activity for at least 30 minutes per day, three days a week. (Source: https://www.pennmedicine.org/updates/blogs/heart-and-vascular-blog/2022/april/ejection-fraction-what-the-numbers-mean.)
- Avoid smoking as this can increase your risk of cardiovascular diseases.
- Managing diabetes involves a healthy lifestyle and a personalized care plan. A balanced diet is essential, focusing on nutrient-rich foods such as non-starchy vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats. Limit refined sugars and simple carbohydrates, manage your carbohydrate intake, and choose foods with a low glycemic index. Regular physical activity is vital,  for at least 30 minutes or more of moderate physical activity most days of the week, or at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity a week. Bouts of activity can be a few minutes during the day. If you haven't been active for a while, start slowly and build up slowly. Also avoid sitting for too long. Try to get up and move if you've been sitting for more than 30 minutes. (Source: https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20371451.)   Monitor blood sugar levels regularly, understand how food, exercise, and medication affect them, and react appropriately to high or low levels. Consult your doctor about whether you should take diabetes medication (e.g., insulin, oral medication). Manage stress with techniques such as meditation or yoga, as stress can affect blood sugar. Regular check-ups and preventative care are vital to identify and manage complications such as eye, kidney, nerve, or heart problems (Source: https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/healthy-living-with-diabetes).
- Since your systolic blood pressure is high, focus on eating colorful fruits and vegetables, since their high potassium content can help lower blood pressure.

Consult your doctor to tell you what you should do to decrease your creatinine levels to normal levels. (Source: https://www.healthline.com/health/low-creatinine#treatment.).
- Since you are diagnosed as overweight person, it’s important to follow their recommendations of your doctor for losing weight. Health professionals recommend losing 5% to 10% of your initial weight over the course of about 6 months. But a loss of just 3% to 5% of your current weight can lower triglycerides and glucose levels in your blood, as well as your risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Losing more than 3% to 5% of your weight can improve blood pressure readings, lower “bad” LDL cholesterol, and increase “good” HDL cholesterol. (Source: https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/heart-truth/maintain-a-healthy-weight).

MESSAGE FOR PATIENT:
The condition is serious, with increased risk to your health. However, measures can be taken to improve the situation.
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PATIENT Giannopoulos Giannis:
- Since your low ejection fraction is low (LVEF < 40), you can follow instructions that will help to  improve your injection fraction.The average American consumes nearly 3,400 mg of sodium per day, which is more than double the recommended amount. Aim to reduce salt consumption to align with recommended levels. Check food labels and avoid processed or high-sodium foods. Discuss with your cardiologist the appropriate amount of fluids you should consume daily. Also, engage in physical activity for at least 30 minutes per day, three days a week. (Source: https://www.pennmedicine.org/updates/blogs/heart-and-vascular-blog/2022/april/ejection-fraction-what-the-numbers-mean.)
- Quitting smoking is one of the most impactful steps you can take to improve your health. Smoking increases the risk of serious illnesses like heart disease and lung cancer. Start by setting a quit date within the next two weeks to stay focused and committed. Seek support through counseling and consider using nicotine replacement therapies like patches or gums to ease withdrawal symptoms. Your healthcare provider can also recommend medications to help you quit. Creating a smoke-free environment and identifying triggers can make a big difference in your journey (Source: https://cdphe.colorado.gov/prevention-and-wellness/smoking-and-tobacco/quit-tobacco/recommendations-for-reducing-tobacco-use).
- Managing diabetes involves a healthy lifestyle and a personalized care plan. A balanced diet is essential, focusing on nutrient-rich foods such as non-starchy vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats. Limit refined sugars and simple carbohydrates, manage your carbohydrate intake, and choose foods with a low glycemic index. Regular physical activity is vital,  for at least 30 minutes or more of moderate physical activity most days of the week, or at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity a week. Bouts of activity can be a few minutes during the day. If you haven't been active for a while, start slowly and build up slowly. Also avoid sitting for too long. Try to get up and move if you've been sitting for more than 30 minutes. (Source: https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20371451.)   Monitor blood sugar levels regularly, understand how food, exercise, and medication affect them, and react appropriately to high or low levels. Consult your doctor about whether you should take diabetes medication (e.g., insulin, oral medication). Manage stress with techniques such as meditation or yoga, as stress can affect blood sugar. Regular check-ups and preventative care are vital to identify and manage complications such as eye, kidney, nerve, or heart problems (Source: https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/healthy-living-with-diabetes).
- Since your systolic blood pressure is high, focus on eating colorful fruits and vegetables, since their high potassium content can help lower blood pressure. Choose whole grains whenever possible, and limit white flours such as those found in white bread and pasta. Avoid drinking sweetened drinks like juice and soda, and watch for salt in processed foods and canned items. Limit intake of saturated fat by choosing lean meats like skinless chicken and turkey. Choose low-fat or nonfat dairy items (Source: https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-to-lower-systolic-blood-pressure-5202628).
- Consult your doctor if beta blocker therapy is necessary.
- The patient has high creatinine levels. High creatinine levels may indicate that your kidneys aren’t filtering your blood properly.  Consult your doctor to tell you what you should do to decrease your creatinine levels to normal levels. (Source: https://www.healthline.com/health/low-creatinine#treatment.).
- As you are a smoker and have COPD, it is critical to quit smoking immediately. Smoking exacerbates COPD symptoms, causes further damage to your lungs, and worsens your overall condition.
- Since you are diagnosed as overweight person, it’s important to follow their recommendations of your doctor for losing weight. Health professionals recommend losing 5% to 10% of your initial weight over the course of about 6 months. But a loss of just 3% to 5% of your current weight can lower triglycerides and glucose levels in your blood, as well as your risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Losing more than 3% to 5% of your weight can improve blood pressure readings, lower “bad” LDL cholesterol, and increase “good” HDL cholesterol. (Source: https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/heart-truth/maintain-a-healthy-weight).

MESSAGE FOR DOCTOR:
The patient is at high risk and requires intensive management. Comprehensive and multidisciplinary care is critical.
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR DOCTOR TO PATIENT Giannopoulos Giannis:
- The patient has a low ejection fraction (LVEF < 40). Υou may suggest treatments such as an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) or a pacemaker to help regulate the heart rhythm and prevent sudden cardiac arrest (Source: https://www.healthline.com/health/ejection-fraction#low-ef-causes.)
- Recommend quit-smoking medications to patients, including nicotine replacement therapies (such as nicotine patches, lozenges, gum, oral inhalers, and nasal sprays) and prescription medications like varenicline and bupropion SR (Source: https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/campaign/tips/quit-smoking/quit-smoking-medications/how-to-use-quit-smoking-medicines/index.html).
- The patient has diabetes. Υou can provide the following guidelines to help the patient manage their diabetes effectively:
 Perform a comprehensive medical evaluation to classify diabetes, and evaluate for complications or comorbidities.

MESSAGE FOR PATIENT:
The condition is serious, with increased risk to your health. However, measures can be taken to improve the situation.
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PATIENT Papagianni Panagiwta:
- Since your low ejection fraction is low (LVEF < 40), you can follow instructions that will help to  improve your injection fraction.The average American consumes nearly 3,400 mg of sodium per day, which is more than double the recommended amount. Aim to reduce salt consumption to align with recommended levels. Check food labels and avoid processed or high-sodium foods. Discuss with your cardiologist the appropriate amount of fluids you should consume daily. Also, engage in physical activity for at least 30 minutes per day, three days a week. (Source: https://www.pennmedicine.org/updates/blogs/heart-and-vascular-blog/2022/april/ejection-fraction-what-the-numbers-mean.)
- Avoid smoking as this can increase your risk of cardiovascular diseases.
- Managing diabetes involves a healthy lifestyle and a personalized care plan. A balanced diet is essential, focusing on nutrient-rich foods such as non-starchy vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats. Limit refined sugars and simple carbohydrates, manage your carbohydrate intake, and choose foods with a low glycemic index. Regular physical activity is vital,  for at least 30 minutes or more of moderate physical activity most days of the week, or at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity a week. Bouts of activity can be a few minutes during the day. If you haven't been active for a while, start slowly and build up slowly. Also avoid sitting for too long. Try to get up and move if you've been sitting for more than 30 minutes. (Source: https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20371451.)   Monitor blood sugar levels regularly, understand how food, exercise, and medication affect them, and react appropriately to high or low levels. Consult your doctor about whether you should take diabetes medication (e.g., insulin, oral medication). Manage stress with techniques such as meditation or yoga, as stress can affect blood sugar. Regular check-ups and preventative care are vital to identify and manage complications such as eye, kidney, nerve, or heart problems (Source: https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/healthy-living-with-diabetes).
- Since your systolic blood pressure is high, focus on eating colorful fruits and vegetables, since their high potassium content can help lower blood pressure. Choose whole grains whenever possible, and limit white flours such as those found in white bread and pasta. Avoid drinking sweetened drinks like juice and soda, and watch for salt in processed foods and canned items. Limit intake of saturated fat by choosing lean meats like skinless chicken and turkey. Choose low-fat or nonfat dairy items (Source: https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-to-lower-systolic-blood-pressure-5202628).
- Consult your doctor if beta blocker therapy is necessary.
- Consult your doctor if ACE inhibitors or ARBs therapy is necessary.
- The patient has high creatinine levels. High creatinine levels may indicate that your kidneys aren’t filtering your blood properly.  Consult your doctor to tell you what you should do to decrease your creatinine levels to normal levels. (Source: https://www.healthline.com/health/low-creatinine#treatment.).
- Since you are diagnosed as obesity person, it’s important to follow their recommendations of your doctor for losing weight. Health professionals recommend losing 5% to 10% of your initial weight over the course of about 6 months. But a loss of just 3% to 5% of your current weight can lower triglycerides and glucose levels in your blood, as well as your risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Losing more than 3% to 5% of your weight can improve blood pressure readings, lower “bad” LDL cholesterol, and increase “good” HDL cholesterol (Source: https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/heart-truth/maintain-a-healthy-weight).

MESSAGE FOR DOCTOR:

According to the American College of Cardiology (ACC), the patient has Severe dysfunction (LVEF < 30%) 
For information, Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is the central measure of left ventricular systolic function. LVEF is the fraction of chamber volume ejected in systole (stroke volume) in relation to the volume of the blood in the ventricle at the end of diastole (end-diastolic volume).
(Source: https://www.healthline.com/health/ejection-fraction#ejection-fraction-results, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459131/).
Regarding diabetes, the patient Dimitriadis Dhmhtrhs has been diagnosed with diabetes.
Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot
effectively use the insulin it produces. Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood glucose. Hyperglycaemia, also called raised blood glucose,
is a common effect of uncontrolled diabetes and over time leads to serious damage to many of the body's systems, especially the nerves and blood vessels.
The patient Dimitriadis Dhmhtrhs doesn't smoke.
 The patient Dimitriadis Dhmhtrhs has COPD disease. For Information, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the name for a group of lung conditions that cause breathing difficulties. It includes: emphysema – damage to the air sacs in the lungs or chronic bronchitis – long-term inflammation of the airways. COPD is a common condition that mainly affects middle-aged or older adults who smoke. Many people do not realise they have it.The breathing problems tend to get gradually worse over time and can limit your normal activities, although treatment can help keep the condition under control.
The patient's Dimitriadis Dhmhtrhs systolic pressure is 170 mm Hg and is characterized as 'High Blood Pressure Stage 2' (140 or higher systolic pressure).
Regarding heart failure medications, the patient doesn't take beta blockers therapy. Moreover, doesn't take ACE inhibitors or ARBs therapy.
The patient Dimitriadis Dhmhtrhs has a creatinine level of 2.5 mg/dL and is categorized as High (above 1.2 mg/dL).
(Source: https://www.healthline.com/health/low-creatinine#creatinine-levels.)
The Body Mass Index (BMI) of the patient Dimitriadis Dhmhtrhs is 31.0.
Body mass index (BMI) is a measure of body fat based on height and weight that applies to adult men and women.
So, based on the existing scientific literature, the patient Dimitriadis Dhmhtrhs with this BMI can be characterized as 'Obesity'.
(Source: https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/BMI/bmicalc.htm.).

The predicted mortality of the patient Dimitriadis Dhmhtrhs for 3-Year is 72.5%. Namely, there is a 72.5% change that the patient may not survive within the next three years due to heart-related conditions.

MESSAGE FOR PATIENT:
The condition is serious, with increased risk to your health. However, measures can be taken to improve the situation.
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PATIENT Dimitriadis Dhmhtrhs:
- Since your low ejection fraction is low (LVEF < 40), you can follow instructions that will help to  improve your injection fraction.The average American consumes nearly 3,400 mg of sodium per day, which is more than double the recommended amount. Aim to reduce salt consumption to align with recommended levels. Check food labels and avoid processed or high-sodium foods. Discuss with your cardiologist the appropriate amount of fluids you should consume daily. Also, engage in physical activity for at least 30 minutes per day, three days a week. (Source: https://www.pennmedicine.org/updates/blogs/heart-and-vascular-blog/2022/april/ejection-fraction-what-the-numbers-mean.)
- Avoid smoking as this can increase your risk of cardiovascular diseases.
- Managing diabetes involves a healthy lifestyle and a personalized care plan. A balanced diet is essential, focusing on nutrient-rich foods such as non-starchy vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats. Limit refined sugars and simple carbohydrates, manage your carbohydrate intake, and choose foods with a low glycemic index. Regular physical activity is vital,  for at least 30 minutes or more of moderate physical activity most days of the week, or at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity a week. Bouts of activity can be a few minutes during the day. If you haven't been active for a while, start slowly and build up slowly. Also avoid sitting for too long. Try to get up and move if you've been sitting for more than 30 minutes. (Source: https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20371451.)   Monitor blood sugar levels regularly, understand how food, exercise, and medication affect them, and react appropriately to high or low levels. Consult your doctor about whether you should take diabetes medication (e.g., insulin, oral medication). Manage stress with techniques such as meditation or yoga, as stress can affect blood sugar. Regular check-ups and preventative care are vital to identify and manage complications such as eye, kidney, nerve, or heart problems (Source: https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/healthy-living-with-diabetes).
- Since your systolic blood pressure is high, focus on eating colorful fruits and vegetables, since their high potassium content can help lower blood pressure. Choose whole grains whenever possible, and limit white flours such as those found in white bread and pasta. Avoid drinking sweetened drinks like juice and soda, and watch for salt in processed foods and canned items. Limit intake of saturated fat by choosing lean meats like skinless chicken and turkey. Choose low-fat or nonfat dairy items (Source: https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-to-lower-systolic-blood-pressure-5202628).
- Consult your doctor if beta blocker therapy is necessary.
- Consult your doctor if ACE inhibitors or ARBs therapy is necessary.
- The patient has high creatinine levels. High creatinine levels may indicate that your kidneys aren’t filtering your blood properly.  Consult your doctor to tell you what you should do to decrease your creatinine levels to normal levels. (Source: https://www.healthline.com/health/low-creatinine#treatment.).
- You have COPD, so you need to avoiding triggers such as dust, fumes, and extreme temperatures can minimize flare-ups. Also, vaccinations against flu, pneumonia, and COVID-19 are essential to prevent infections that could worsen the condition.  Breathing techniques, like pursed-lip breathing, and physical activity help improve lung function and stamina  (Source: https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-copd/living-with/).
- Since you are diagnosed as obesity person, it’s important to follow their recommendations of your doctor for losing weight. Health professionals recommend losing 5% to 10% of your initial weight over the course of about 6 months. But a loss of just 3% to 5% of your current weight can lower triglycerides and glucose levels in your blood, as well as your risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Losing more than 3% to 5% of your weight can improve blood pressure readings, lower “bad” LDL cholesterol, and increase “good” HDL cholesterol (Source: https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/heart-truth/maintain-a-healthy-weight).

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PATIENT xalkia Marina:
- Avoid smoking as this can increase your risk of cardiovascular diseases.
- Since your systolic blood pressure is high, focus on eating colorful fruits and vegetables, since their high potassium content can help lower blood pressure. Choose whole grains whenever possible, and limit white flours such as those found in white bread and pasta. Avoid drinking sweetened drinks like juice and soda, and watch for salt in processed foods and canned items. Limit intake of saturated fat by choosing lean meats like skinless chicken and turkey. Choose low-fat or nonfat dairy items (Source: https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-to-lower-systolic-blood-pressure-5202628).
- Consult your doctor if beta blocker therapy is necessary.
- You have COPD, so you need to avoiding triggers such as dust, fumes, and extreme temperatures can minimize flare-ups. Also, vaccinations against flu, pneumonia, and COVID-19 are essential to prevent infections that could worsen the condition.  Breathing techniques, like pursed-lip breathing, and physical activity help improve lung function and stamina  (Source: https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-copd/living-with/).
- Your BMI is in the normal range, which is great for your overall health. Focus on maintaining your current weight and healthy habits.

MESSAGE FOR DOCTOR:
The patient has a favorable prognosis. Continuing current management and preventive strategies is key to maintaining health.
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR DOCTOR TO PATIENT xalkia Marina:
- Advise the patient to avoid smoking, as it increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases.
- The patient has COPD. There are various treatment options to discuss with the patient,  such as using inhalers (the first treatment used are short-acting bronchodilator inhalers (beta-2 agonist inhalers such as salbutamol and terbutaline and antimuscarinic inhalers such as ipratropium. The next phase if  the patient experience symptoms regularly or have flare-ups (exacerbations) despite using short-acting bronchodilators, a long-acting bronchodilator inhaler may be recommended i.e. beta-2 agonist inhalers – such as salmeterol, formoterol and indacaterol and antimuscarinic inhalers – such as tiotropium, glycopyronium and aclidinium),  if the long-acting bronchodilator inhaler didn't make any difference to the symptoms consider steroid inhalers and if the symptopms of the patients are not controlled with inhalers, recommend taking tablets or capsules as well.  (Source: https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-copd/treatment/).
- Since the systolic blood pressure is high, consider prescribing one of the following medications, which are effective at reducing blood pressure: 1. diuretics such as Hygroton (chlorthalidone), Microzide (hydrochlorothiazide). 2. Calcium channel Blocker such as Norvasc (amlodipine) and Adalat CC (nifedipine). Also, advise the patient to avoid the following substances, which can negatively impact blood pressure management i.e.  Over-the-counter 'decongestant' cold medications that contain pseudoephedrine or phenylephrine, like Sudafed, chronic use of NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications), like Motrin (ibuprofen), Advil (ibuprofen), and Aleve (naproxen). Also, black licorice and cocaine (Source: https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-to-lower-systolic-blood-pressure-5202628).
- Consider administering Beta blocker therapy (Bisoprolol (Zebeta), Carvedilol (Coreg), Metoprolol (Toprol))  to the patient, if necessary. Also, the goal is to convince the patient not to neglect taking Beta blocker therapy since they are very important (Source: https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/heart-failure/heart-failure-beta-blocker) .

MESSAGE FOR PATIENT:
There is a moderate risk to your health. With certain adjustments, your prognosis can improve. By taking proactive steps and following your doctor’s instructions, you can reduce your risk and improve your quality of life.
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PATIENT arvanitidis manolos:
- Since your low ejection fraction is low (LVEF < 40), you can follow instructions that will help to  improve your injection fraction.The average American consumes nearly 3,400 mg of sodium per day, which is more than double the recommended amount. Aim to reduce salt consumption to align with recommended levels. Check food labels and avoid processed or high-sodium foods. Discuss with your cardiologist the appropriate amount of fluids you should consume daily. Also, engage in physical activity for at least 30 minutes per day, three days a week. (Source: https://www.pennmedicine.org/updates/blogs/heart-and-vascular-blog/2022/april/ejection-fraction-what-the-numbers-mean.)
- Quitting smoking is one of the most impactful steps you can take to improve your health. Smoking increases the risk of serious illnesses like heart disease and lung cancer. Start by setting a quit date within the next two weeks to stay focused and committed. Seek support through counseling and consider using nicotine replacement therapies like patches or gums to ease withdrawal symptoms. Your healthcare provider can also recommend medications to help you quit. Creating a smoke-free environment and identifying triggers can make a big difference in your journey (Source: https://cdphe.colorado.gov/prevention-and-wellness/smoking-and-tobacco/quit-tobacco/recommendations-for-reducing-tobacco-use).
- Consult your doctor if beta blocker therapy is necessary.
- Consult your doctor if ACE inhibitors or ARBs therapy is necessary.
- As you are a smoker and have COPD, it is critical to quit smoking immediately. Smoking exacerbates COPD symptoms, causes further damage to your lungs, and worsens your overall condition.
- Since you are diagnosed as overweight person, it’s important to follow their recommendations of your doctor for losing weight. Health professionals recommend losing 5% to 10% of your initial weight over the course of about 6 months. But a loss of just 3% to 5% of your current weight can lower triglycerides and glucose levels in your blood, as well as your risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Losing more than 3% to 5% of your weight can improve blood pressure readings, lower “bad” LDL cholesterol, and increase “good” HDL cholesterol. (Source: https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/heart-truth/maintain-a-healthy-weight).

Regarding diabetes, the patient Antuine Antonios has been diagnosed with diabetes.
Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot
effectively use the insulin it produces. Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood glucose. Hyperglycaemia, also called raised blood glucose,
is a common effect of uncontrolled diabetes and over time leads to serious damage to many of the body's systems, especially the nerves and blood vessels.
The patient Antuine Antonios doesn't smoke.
 The patient Antuine Antonios has COPD disease. For Information, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the name for a group of lung conditions that cause breathing difficulties. It includes: emphysema – damage to the air sacs in the lungs or chronic bronchitis – long-term inflammation of the airways. COPD is a common condition that mainly affects middle-aged or older adults who smoke. Many people do not realise they have it.The breathing problems tend to get gradually worse over time and can limit your normal activities, although treatment can help keep the condition under control.
The patient's Antuine Antonios systolic pressure is 140 mm Hg and is characterized as 'High Blood Pressure Stage 2' (140 or higher systolic pressure).
Regarding heart failure medications, the patient doesn't take beta blockers therapy. Moreover, doesn't take ACE inhibitors or ARBs therapy.

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PATIENT Antuine Antonios:
- Since your low ejection fraction is low (LVEF < 40), you can follow instructions that will help to  improve your injection fraction.The average American consumes nearly 3,400 mg of sodium per day, which is more than double the recommended amount. Aim to reduce salt consumption to align with recommended levels. Check food labels and avoid processed or high-sodium foods. Discuss with your cardiologist the appropriate amount of fluids you should consume daily. Also, engage in physical activity for at least 30 minutes per day, three days a week. (Source: https://www.pennmedicine.org/updates/blogs/heart-and-vascular-blog/2022/april/ejection-fraction-what-the-numbers-mean.)
- Avoid smoking as this can increase your risk of cardiovascular diseases.
- Managing diabetes involves a healthy lifestyle and a personalized care plan. A balanced diet is essential, focusing on nutrient-rich foods such as non-starchy vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats. Limit refined sugars and simple carbohydrates, manage your carbohydrate intake, and choose foods with a low glycemic index. Regular physical activity is vital,  for at least 30 minutes or more of moderate physical activity most days of the week, or at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity a week. Bouts of activity can be a few minutes during the day. If you haven't been active for a while, start slowly and build up slowly. Also avoid sitting for too long. Try to get up and move if you've been sitting for more than 30 minutes. (Source: https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20371451.)   Monitor blood sugar levels regularly, understand how food, exercise, and medication affect them, and react appropriately to high or low levels. Consult your doctor about whether you should take diabetes medication (e.g., insulin, oral medication). Manage stress with techniques such as meditation or yoga, as stress can affect blood sugar. Regular check-ups and preventative care are vital to identify and manage complications such as eye, kidney, nerve, or heart problems (Source: https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/healthy-living-with-diabetes).
- Since your systolic blood pressure is high, focus on eating colorful fruits and vegetables, since their high potassium content can help lower blood pressure. Choose whole grains whenever possible, and limit white flours such as those found in white bread and pasta. Avoid drinking sweetened drinks like juice and soda, and watch for salt in processed foods and canned items. Limit intake of saturated fat by choosing lean meats like skinless chicken and turkey. Choose low-fat or nonfat dairy items (Source: https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-to-lower-systolic-blood-pressure-5202628).
- Consult your doctor if beta blocker therapy is necessary.
